# IPTV-M3US

Welcome to Bitsbb01's Github, i do a lot in IPTV and in process of setting up the best kodi package...


Looking for way and may need to write a script to pull all the streams from hlscat into a valid m3u with only the working streams daily. this is going to be my next project... unless someone's already created a script or kodi addon that pulls from hlscat... If you know how to do this, please let me know in the Discussions. 



** If anyone can provide the webgrab files for Cine Film and the MBC channels, then i'll include those in my epg. I havent found a working english version at all yet.. **
