# IPTV-M3US

Welcome to Bitsbb01's Github, i do a lot in IPTV and in process of setting up the best kodi package...


Looking for way and may need to write a script to pull all the streams from hlscat into a valid m3u with only the working streams daily. this is going to be my next project... unless someone's already created a script or kodi addon that pulls from hlscat... 



If anyone can provide the webgrab files for Cine Film and the MBC channels, then i'll include those in my epg. I havent found a working english version at all yet..
